        #### Endosurgery Equipment

        One of my first project at Smart Design was to prototype [surgery equipment UI](https://vimeo.com/50313470) for Ethicon. We took apart and rewired a bunch of endosurgery equipment, hooked them onto an Arduino, and prototyped a bunch of surgery workflows.

            p.caption The prototype recognizes which endosurgery equipment is connected. It's loading the workflow for a different sealer.

            p.caption Itâ€™s ready! This sealer has a different UI, sound design, and interaction model.
