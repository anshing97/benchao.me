    #### Endosurgery Equipment

    One of my first project at Smart Design was to prototype [surgery equipment UI](https://vimeo.com/50313470) for Ethicon. We designed a  clean user interface and worked with [Ben Rubin](https://twitter.com/earstudio) for the sound design. However, we weren't satisfied just handing over specs and sound clips. We wanted our clients to experience the whole thing. We ended up rewiring a bunch of endosurgery equipment, hooked them onto an Arduino, and prototyped a bunch of surgery workflows.
